# Code Generation for Free with Partial Evaluation

This code is the result of my course project for CSE 501, Implementation of Programming Languages. See my project report, `report.pdf`. The `examples` directory contains the code for the two examples in the report, arithmetic expressions and tree traversal schedules. The files named `arith.*` go with the former, and the files named `sched.*` go with the latter. In the respective Racket files, `program` is bound to an example program in the language; `get-residual` computes the residual program, and `get-output` translates that residual program to the target language (OCaml). Each directory also contains a manually prettified version of the example program, in a `*.ml` file. An associated shell script (`*.sh`) runs this in the OCaml interactive shell, `utop`.
